PS : 3 | Agritech: Crop Monitoring & Disease Detection Platform
description : Build a farmer-centric mobile application that allows farmers to select and register the crops they have planted, such as wheat, rice, or jowar, and continuously monitor and plan crop growth throughout the entire farming season. The system should use AI-driven insights instead of generic farming tips by combining crop growth stages, local soil conditions, weather patterns, and farmer inputs to provide daily and stage-wise recommendations on irrigation, fertilization, pest prevention, and yield improvement. The platform must allow farmers to capture images of their crops using a mobile phone camera and send them to the system for analysis by custom AI/ML models trained to detect crop diseases, pest attacks, nutrient deficiencies, and stress conditions at an early stage. To be practical in real farming environments, the application should work reliably under rural constraints such as poor internet connectivity, low-end smartphones, and limited digital literacy. It should support voice-based interaction for farmers who are not comfortable with typing, allow offline data and photo capture with delayed synchronization when connectivity is available, and deliver region- and crop-specific advice rather than broad, generic suggestions.

The system must enforce zero-trust access control, fine-grained user permissions, immutable audit logs, and cryptographic key management with customer-controlled keys. It must support large-file uploads via resumable, chunked transfer with deduplication, integrity verification, versioning, and safe retry mechanisms that prevent data corruption or overwrite on failure. Users must be able to modify, pause, resume, and retry uploads seamlessly, with strong consistency guarantees, encryption at rest and in transit, verifiable compliance reporting, and predictable low-cost storage economics without sacrificing performance, durability, or regulatory auditability.
Problem Statement 3: Intelligent Deepfake Detection and Trust Verification System
description : Build an intelligent deepfake detection and trust verification system that can identify AI-generated or manipulated media content across images, videos, and audio in real-time. The system must analyze digital content for authenticity markers, detecting sophisticated deepfakes, face-swaps, voice cloning, and synthetic media created by advanced generative AI models. It should employ multi-modal analysis combining visual artifacts, audio inconsistencies, temporal anomalies, and metadata forensics to establish content provenance and authenticity. The platform must handle high-resolution media, provide confidence scores and explainable detection results showing specific indicators of manipulation, operate under time constraints for real-time verification (news, social media, legal evidence), and maintain high accuracy even as deepfake generation techniques evolve. The system should support forensic-grade evidence trails, integrate blockchain-based content certification for establishing original authenticity, detect partial manipulations within otherwise genuine content, and provide APIs for integration with social media platforms, news organizations, and legal institutions. It must balance false positive rates to avoid flagging legitimate edited content while maintaining high true positive rates for actual deepfakes, and continuously adapt to emerging deepfake generation methods through adversarial training and model updates.
